# Welcome to Crop-Recommender-System

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which aims to recommend the most suitable crop to grow given a set of environmental conditions. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Practical Motivation 

With the rising prices of water, fertilisers and other resources needed for farming, precision agriculture harnesses the potential to increase crop yields and profitability while lowering the resources (e.g. water, fertilisers) needed to grow crops. Farmers can make informed decisions about the farming strategy. Hence, we focused on building a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters including temperature and humidity levels.

## Problem Definition 
- Are we able to accurately predict the type of crop to be planted based on a given set of environmental conditions?

## Data Preparation
1 dataset used: crop recommender dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)
 
Workflow for this section:

1. Inspection of dataset 

- We checked if the datatype of each attribute in the dataset is appropriate. For example, since we are looking at temperature at a numerical value, temperature attribute in the dataset should not be of datatype boolean.

- We checked for 2 data anomalies

    - Missing values

    - Duplicate values

## Exploratory Data Analysis 


## Algorithm Optimisation and Machine Learning


## Conclusions Derived


## Ethical Considerations and Intelligent Decisions


## Future Works that can be done

- Instead of recommending the crop given a set of conditions, future works can be done on predicting the optimal conditions for each type of crop.

## Additional Learning Points from this Project beyond Lectures

- A new EDA technique called XXX

- Implemented various AI models, including XXX

- Learnt additional performance metrics used to evaluate AI models, including XXX

- Collaborating on GitHub
